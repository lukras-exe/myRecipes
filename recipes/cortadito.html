    <h2>Cortadito - Authentic Cuban Coffee Recipe</h2>
    <img src = "cortadito.jpg" alt="Cortadito">

    <h4>A cortadito is a traditional Cuban coffee drink that combines strong espresso
        with steamed milk, in equal parts, and is heavily sweetened with sugar. 
        The name "cortadito" translates to "little cut" in Spanish, refering to the 
        way the strong espresso is "cut" or diluted with milk. It is similar to a Spanish
        cortado but it is sweeter and often served in smaller portions. Unlike a cafe con leche,
        which may use more molk and is not neccessarily sweetened, a cortadito is distinct for its 
        bold, sweet flavor profile.
